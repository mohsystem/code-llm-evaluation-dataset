Given an integer array nums and two integers lower and upper, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.

Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j inclusive, where i <= j.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The three ranges are: [0,0], [2,2], and [0,2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0], lower = 0, upper = 0
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
-10^5 <= lower <= upper <= 10^5
The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Given an integer array nums, return the number of reverse pairs in the array.

A reverse pair is a pair (i, j) where:

0 <= i < j < nums.length and
nums[i] > 2 * nums[j].
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: The reverse pairs are:
(1, 4) --> nums[1] = 3, nums[4] = 1, 3 > 2 * 1
(3, 4) --> nums[3] = 3, nums[4] = 1, 3 > 2 * 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,4,3,5,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The reverse pairs are:
(1, 4) --> nums[1] = 4, nums[4] = 1, 4 > 2 * 1
(2, 4) --> nums[2] = 3, nums[4] = 1, 3 > 2 * 1
(3, 4) --> nums[3] = 5, nums[4] = 1, 5 > 2 * 1

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
 

Constraints:

nums1.length == m
nums2.length == n
0 <= m <= 1000
0 <= n <= 1000
1 <= m + n <= 2000
-106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^6

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

 

Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
Example 2:

Input: lists = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
 

Constraints:

k == lists.length
0 <= k <= 10^4
0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4
lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 10^4.

You have a function printNumber that can be called with an integer parameter and prints it to the console.

For example, calling printNumber(7) prints 7 to the console.
You are given an instance of the class ZeroEvenOdd that has three functions: zero, even, and odd. The same instance of ZeroEvenOdd will be passed to three different threads:

Thread A: calls zero() that should only output 0's.
Thread B: calls even() that should only output even numbers.
Thread C: calls odd() that should only output odd numbers.
Modify the given class to output the series "010203040506..." where the length of the series must be 2n.

Implement the ZeroEvenOdd class:

ZeroEvenOdd(int n) Initializes the object with the number n that represents the numbers that should be printed.
void zero(printNumber) Calls printNumber to output one zero.
void even(printNumber) Calls printNumber to output one even number.
void odd(printNumber) Calls printNumber to output one odd number.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: "0102"
Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously.
One of them calls zero(), the other calls even(), and the last one calls odd().
"0102" is the correct output.
Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: "0102030405"

Given an integer array nums and two integers lower and upper, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.

Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j inclusive, where i <= j.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The three ranges are: [0,0], [2,2], and [0,2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0], lower = 0, upper = 0
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
-10^5 <= lower <= upper <= 10^5
The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Given an integer array nums, return the number of reverse pairs in the array.

A reverse pair is a pair (i, j) where:

0 <= i < j < nums.length and
nums[i] > 2 * nums[j].
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: The reverse pairs are:
(1, 4) --> nums[1] = 3, nums[4] = 1, 3 > 2 * 1
(3, 4) --> nums[3] = 3, nums[4] = 1, 3 > 2 * 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,4,3,5,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The reverse pairs are:
(1, 4) --> nums[1] = 4, nums[4] = 1, 4 > 2 * 1
(2, 4) --> nums[2] = 3, nums[4] = 1, 3 > 2 * 1
(3, 4) --> nums[3] = 5, nums[4] = 1, 5 > 2 * 1

You have a function printNumber that can be called with an integer parameter and prints it to the console.

For example, calling printNumber(7) prints 7 to the console.
You are given an instance of the class ZeroEvenOdd that has three functions: zero, even, and odd. The same instance of ZeroEvenOdd will be passed to three different threads:

Thread A: calls zero() that should only output 0's.
Thread B: calls even() that should only output even numbers.
Thread C: calls odd() that should only output odd numbers.
Modify the given class to output the series "010203040506..." where the length of the series must be 2n.

Implement the ZeroEvenOdd class:

ZeroEvenOdd(int n) Initializes the object with the number n that represents the numbers that should be printed.
void zero(printNumber) Calls printNumber to output one zero.
void even(printNumber) Calls printNumber to output one even number.
void odd(printNumber) Calls printNumber to output one odd number.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: "0102"
Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously.
One of them calls zero(), the other calls even(), and the last one calls odd().
"0102" is the correct output.
Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: "0102030405"

Given an integer array nums and two integers lower and upper, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.

Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j inclusive, where i <= j.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The three ranges are: [0,0], [2,2], and [0,2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0], lower = 0, upper = 0
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
-10^5 <= lower <= upper <= 10^5
The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

 

Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
Example 2:

Input: lists = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
 

Constraints:

k == lists.length
0 <= k <= 10^4
0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4
lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 10^4.

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
 

Constraints:

nums1.length == m
nums2.length == n
0 <= m <= 1000
0 <= n <= 1000
1 <= m + n <= 2000

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

 

Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
Example 2:

Input: lists = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
 

Constraints:

k == lists.length
0 <= k <= 10^4
0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4
lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 10^4.

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
 

Constraints:

nums1.length == m
nums2.length == n
0 <= m <= 1000
0 <= n <= 1000
1 <= m + n <= 2000
-106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^6
