## Introduction
Dataset for evaluating LLMs generated code, developed for "Security and Quality in LLM-Generated Code: A Multi-Language, Multi-Model Analysis" research paper.

The current benchmark focuses on **self-contained tasks** at the function and file level. These tasks are designed to isolate core building blocks that frequently appear in real applications, while still being small enough to analyze systematically and at scale.

## Goals

1. **Measure baseline behavior** of LLMs on security- and correctness-sensitive code patterns.
2. **Provide a reproducible benchmark** for comparing models, prompts, and evaluation strategies.
3. **Lay the groundwork for system-level evaluations**, where LLM-generated code is embedded in services and multi-module projects.


## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mohkharma/code-llm-evaluation-dataset.git`
2. Review the prompt description files existing in the repository - dataset/promptDescription-XXX.
3. Review the prompt description schema to understand the dataset instance attributes [directory](dataset/promptDescriptionSchema.json).


## Usage
Here's a brief guide on how to use the project:

* Start generation of responses from the AI models using [main.py](python%2Fmain.py)

* Check for generation completeness using [dir_with_file_count.py](python%2Fdir_with_file_count.py) and [extract-missing-files.py](python%2Fextract-missing-files.py)
  
* Reprocess the missing using [reprocess_ai_response.py](python%2Freprocess_ai_response.py)
  
* Fix java class name using [fix_public_class_name_for_java.py](python%2Ffix_public_class_name_for_java.py)

## Cross Tool Static Analysis Setup

To avoid depending on a single SAST tool, we use both **SonarQube** and **CodeQL** in our evaluation. For each programming language, we host public GitHub repositories as mentioned above, that contain all code generated by the five LLMs in our benchmark. CodeQL is configured via GitHub’s native analysis pipelines and the official language specific extensions, so that all LLM generated code is analyzed under a consistent setup. We then export the results from both SonarQube and CodeQL, reviewed all SonarQube reported vulnerabilities, and compare the SonarQube reported vulnerabilities with CodeQL results, with summary statistics provided in the supplementary spreadsheets [directory](python/analysis/).
