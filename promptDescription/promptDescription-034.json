      "prompt_description": "A Narcissistic Number (or Armstrong Number) is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).\n\nFor example, take 153 (3 digits), which is narcissistic:\n\n    1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\nand 1652 (4 digits), which isn't:\n\n    1^4 + 6^4 + 5^4 + 2^4 = 1 + 1296 + 625 + 16 = 1938\nThe Challenge:\n\nYour code must return true or false (not 'true' and 'false') depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number in base 10.\n\nThis may be True and False in your language, e.g. PHP.\n\nError checking for text strings or other invalid inputs is not required, only valid positive non-zero integers will be passed into the function.",
