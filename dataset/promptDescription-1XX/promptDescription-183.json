Your task is to find the largest product of a series of adjacent digits of a specified span within the sequence.\n\nGiven:\n\ninput: A sequence of digits to analyze.\nseries: A sequence of adjacent digits of length equal to a specified span.\nspan: The number of digits in each series.\nproduct: The result of multiplying the digits in a series.\nImplement a function that computes the largest product among all possible series of a given span in the input sequence.\n\nExample:\n\nFor the input \"63915\" and a span of 3:\n\nPossible series: \"639\", \"391\", \"915\"\nProducts: 162 (6 × 3 × 9), 27 (3 × 9 × 1), 45 (9 × 1 × 5)\nThe largest product is 162.",
