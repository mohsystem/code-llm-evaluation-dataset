      "prompt_description": "Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. The cube at the bottom will have a volume of \n\uD835\uDC5B\n3\nn \n3\n , the cube above will have volume of \n(\n\uD835\uDC5B\n−\n1\n)\n3\n(n−1) \n3\n  and so on until the top which will have a volume of \n1\n3\n1 \n3\n .\n\nYou are given the total volume m of the building. Being given m can you find the number n of cubes you will have to build?\n\nThe parameter of the function findNb (find_nb, find-nb, findNb, ...) will be an integer m and you have to return the integer n such as \n\uD835\uDC5B\n3\n+\n(\n\uD835\uDC5B\n−\n1\n)\n3\n+\n(\n\uD835\uDC5B\n−\n2\n)\n3\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\n1\n3\n=\n\uD835\uDC5A\nn \n3\n +(n−1) \n3\n +(n−2) \n3\n +...+1 \n3\n =m if such a n exists or -1 if there is no such n.\n\nExamples:\nfindNb(1071225) --> 45\n\nfindNb(91716553919377) --> -1",
