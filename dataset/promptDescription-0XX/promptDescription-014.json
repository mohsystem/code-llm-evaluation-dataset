      "prompt_description": "You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N.\n\nIf there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.\n\nFor example:\nLet's say you are given the array {1,2,3,4,3,2,1}:\nYour function will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6.\n\nLet's look at another one.\nYou are given the array {1,100,50,-51,1,1}:\nYour function will return the index 1, because at the 1st position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({50,-51,1,1}) both equal 1.\n\nLast one:\nYou are given the array {20,10,-80,10,10,15,35}\nAt index 0 the left side is {}\nThe right side is {10,-80,10,10,15,35}\nThey both are equal to 0 when added. (Empty arrays are equal to 0 in this problem)\nIndex 0 is the place where the left side and right side are equal.\n\nNote: Please remember that in most languages the index of an array starts at 0.\n\nInput\nAn integer array of length 0 < arr < 1000. The numbers in the array can be any integer positive or negative.\n\nOutput\nThe lowest index N where the side to the left of N is equal to the side to the right of N. If you do not find an index that fits these rules, then you will return -1.\n\nNote\nIf you are given an array with multiple answers, return the lowest correct index.",
