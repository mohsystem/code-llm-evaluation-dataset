/*
C language does not have built-in support for generating RSA private keys in OpenSSH format.
It is recommended to use a library like OpenSSL to achieve this.
The provided code snippet uses OpenSSL to generate an RSA private key and export it in OpenSSH format.
However, it is not possible to include the entire OpenSSL library in this code snippet.
