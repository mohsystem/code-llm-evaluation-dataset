# Python does not have built-in support for JNDI lookups.
# You can use a library like 'python-jnius' to interact with Java code that uses JNDI.
# However, it's not a straightforward solution and requires Java knowledge.
# Here's a simplified example of how you might use 'python-jnius' to perform a JNDI lookup, but it's not complete and may not work:

from jnius import autoclass

InitialContext = autoclass('javax.naming.InitialContext')
ctx = InitialContext()
lookup = ctx.lookup('java:comp/env/jdbc/MyDB')
