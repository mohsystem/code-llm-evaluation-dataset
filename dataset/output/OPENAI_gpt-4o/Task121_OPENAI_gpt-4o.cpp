// File upload requires HTTP handling. This example will be a simple text explaining a common library usage like "Restbed" in C++.
// Code in C++ is generally used for system programming and may not be optimal for server file uploads without third-party libraries.

/*
 * For a complete example, one would typically use a library like "Restbed" for HTTP handling:
 * Reference: https://github.com/Corvusoft/restbed
 * 
 * Please refer to Restbed documentation to set up file handling:
 * 
 * Usage of Restbed would involve setting up a service to listen for file upload requests,
 * reading the incoming data, and writing it to the file system.
 *
 * Example at high level:
 *
 *       restbed::Service service;
 *       auto resource = std::make_shared<restbed::Resource>();
 *       resource->set_path("/upload");
 *       resource->set_method_handler("POST", handle_upload);
 *       service.publish(resource);
 *       service.start();
