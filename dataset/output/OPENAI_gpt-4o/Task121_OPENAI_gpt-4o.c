// C is a low-level language and doesn't have built-in HTTP server capabilities.
// File upload via HTTP in C would require third-party libraries like libmicrohttpd.

/*
 * For file uploads with C, consider using the libmicrohttpd library.
 * Reference: https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *  The example would involve setting up an HTTP daemon, parsing multipart form data,
 *  and writing the file to the disk.
 *  
 *  The full implementation requires extensive code including handling HTTP requests
 *  and responses which may not be feasible in a small example.
