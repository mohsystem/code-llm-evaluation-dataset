// Note: C doesn't have classes or interfaces like the other languages.
// To adapt this solution, you'd typically pass the array and its size
// to functions instead of using class methods.

// Example function signatures (assuming you have get and length functions):

// int findInMountainArray(int target, int* mountainArr, int size);
// int get(int* mountainArr, int index);
// int length(int* mountainArr);

// The implementation logic would remain similar to the other languages, 
// just adapted to use function calls and pointer arithmetic instead of class methods.
