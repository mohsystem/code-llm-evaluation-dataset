code here:
// Java does not support dynamic memory allocation and deallocation like C or C++. 
// It has automatic garbage collection, so we don't need to manually deallocate memory.
// Here's an example of how you can dynamically allocate memory for an array:
int size = 10;
int[] array = new int[size];
array[0] = 10;
System.out.println(array[0]);  // prints 10
